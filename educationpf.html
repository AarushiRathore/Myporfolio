        Welcome to the Education Page-where we celebrate these years of intensive study, caffeine addiction, and the occasional existential crisis over final exams!
Third Year Bachelor of Computer Applications -

Oh man, this BCA journey! In this crazy ride, I am in my third year of this wild journey, and I've totally been a whiz at coding languages, web development, and pretty much everything tech. Being in the Bachelor of Computer Applications program has felt like a rollercoaster: super exciting, a bit frightening at times, but totally worth it.
Certification in Digital Marketing

After having completely nailed coding, I thought this was a good time to add a little spice with a certification in Digital Marketing. It's like strapping a rocket booster onto my tech skills. I've picked up all the cool tricks of SEO, some social media magic, and how to make your website not just be noticed but actually adored. ????
Currently diving into Data Science

Who doesn't love a good plot twist, huh? I'm just diving into the cool world of Data Science. It's kinda like trying to crack the mysteries of the universe, but with datasets and algorithms as your melee weapons instead. Just wait; I'll emerge from this phase with a superpower-the knack for making sense of numbers and predicting trends like some kind of digital soothsayer. In Summary:

BCA (Bachelor of Computer Applications): I'm in my exciting third year, just coding away!

Digital Marketing Certification: You're all set to make your website pop and dazzle! Data Science: Currently mastering the art of data manipulation and prediction. Hey, hit me up if you want to talk about coding, digital marketing, or that mystical aura surrounding data science. I'm totally down for a nerdy chat over some coffee-fueled brainstorming!
