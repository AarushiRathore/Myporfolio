    <h2> PROJECTS!! </h2>
      Welcome to the Projects pageâ€”showcasing some of my digital dot-com successes, programming projects, and coding puzzles flipped to great solution victories! ðŸ’» ðŸŽ‰

1. WordPress Kingdom

Have you ever wanted a custom site that is as beautiful as a unicorn at a tech meeting? That is exactly what I set out to accomplish in this project. I designed and built a fully custom WordPress site that is eye-catching and optimized for stellar performance. This site has it all-swank design and uncluttered functionality. And thereâ€™s even more! I sprinkled a little digital marketing on top, so it became more than a pretty new face on the web. ðŸŒŸ

Details:

Custom design and build WordPress site
Search engine optimization (SEO) to impress our friends at Google
Facebook ad campaign to make sure we get the word out (and love their code)
2. Data Science Adventure

In this experience, I ventured forth into the world of Data Science, with more coding algorithms and excitement than data! This project involved investigating real world data and made discoveries, identified trends, and created visuals babies and grannies would approve. It was my Indiana Jones meets Microsoft Excel project.

Details:

Data cleaning
Trend analysis and predictive modeling
Interactive dashboards to help make data feel alive
3. Coding Conundrums

What do you get when you mix a good dose of coding languages, a little creativity, and the metabolic boost of caffeine? You get this! A software product solution in multiple coding languages to address real world problems! Whether writing the code for a standard C++ algorithm or developing and pulling together a commercial application in JavaScript; this project represents my ability to pull multiple coding skills into one unified coding deliverable.

Details:

Implementation of algorithms that exists or did not exist.
Anticipating building in multiple programming languages in the coordinated project engagement.
Uncluttered user interface simplified as enjoyable as operating a TV remote. 
      4. The SEO Superstar

Imagine a delightful website that has a high ranking, better than your favorite cat video on YouTube. This is the goal of this SEO project I built: a website that stands out from the digital herd.

The highlights include:

- robust keyword research and addendum
- on page and off page SEO optimization
- reporting and analytics on success

To recap:
WordPress Wonderland: A sparkling website with all the SEO and marketing bells and whistles
Data Science Adventure: Data that has been analyzed and explored into a predictive side note
Coding Conundrum Chronicles: A is an awe-inspiring project with coding languages galore
SEO Superstar: A website that climbs high in search engine rankings, the way youâ€™d expect. 

Cut and paste these projects to see how I combine some technical skills with a bit of whimsy. If you are planning a project and just want to talk tech, please contact me, Iâ€™m always up for a new challenge.
